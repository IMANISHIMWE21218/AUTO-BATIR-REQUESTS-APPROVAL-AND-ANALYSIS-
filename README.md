# AUTO-BATIR-REQUESTS-APPROVAL-AND-ANALYSIS-
The main purpose of this research project is focused on the design of AUTO-BATIR REQUESTS APPROVAL AND ANALYSIS SYSTEM whereby the citizens will be able to request and get construction permits online. 
The basic purpose of this system is to ease all the processes involved in processing construction permits by eradicating corruption, use of papers, and wastage of funds with the use of technology the system will ensure good services to citizens, keep data, and analysis of issued permits.
This platform was developed using different technologies and tools and among others we have: 
UML for the analysis, SQLite for creating databases, HTML and JavaScript as a programming language for the system Front-end, and Django as a Python framework for the back-end.
Moreover, different tests were carried out to make sure that the system is meeting the Userâ€™s needs and therefore works as expected.

**Statement of Problem**
The current ways of processing construction documents and producing construction permits are analog and it takes a long time, founds and sometimes corruption is involved while going through all those processes because it requires people who are requesting construction permits to meet with those who are supposed to be serving them, that is where some unprofessional employees ask for money or some other fevers to quickly provide construction permit without considering or following construction regulations and standards of Kigali city office. This leads to problems of slams, land scarcity, and collapsing of unproper constructed buildings which is a Halm to Rwandans in general.  And also, a lot of funds are being wasted when the listed above problems occur, some people might be forced to demolish their buildings.
And for the use of the documents, there is an issue with data storage and security because the data is being handled manually which also leads to difficulties in analyzing and keeping track of ongoing construction activities in the city.
